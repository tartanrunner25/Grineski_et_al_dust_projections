These files include geo-referenced PM2.5 concentration from dust sources only (geotif format). This includes all dust sources across the Western U.S. There are 10 files, each corresponding to a different projection:

10p_wasatch_front_1275mASL.tif           -GSL with lake elevation set to 1275mASL, and assumes 10% erodibility for exposed portions of GSL lake bed
10p_wasatch_front_1277mASL.tif           -GSL with lake elevation set to 1277mASL, and assumes 10% erodibility for exposed portions of GSL lake bed
10p_wasatch_front_1280mASL.tif           -GSL with lake elevation set to 1280mASL, and assumes 10% erodibility for exposed portions of GSL lake bed
10p_wasatch_front_1281mASL.tif           -GSL with lake elevation set to 1281mASL, and assumes 10% erodibility for exposed portions of GSL lake bed
10p_wasatch_front_gsl_no_lake.tif        -GSL with lake elevation set to 1250mASL (lake is removed), and assumes 10% erodibility for exposed portions of GSL lake bed
20p_wasatch_front_1275mASL.tif           -GSL with lake elevation set to 1275mASL, and assumes 20% erodibility for exposed portions of GSL lake bed
20p_wasatch_front_1277mASL.tif           -GSL with lake elevation set to 1277mASL, and assumes 20% erodibility for exposed portions of GSL lake bed
20p_wasatch_front_1280mASL.tif           -GSL with lake elevation set to 1280mASL, and assumes 20% erodibility for exposed portions of GSL lake bed
20p_wasatch_front_1281mASL.tif           -GSL with lake elevation set to 1281mASL, and assumes 20% erodibility for exposed portions of GSL lake bed
20p_wasatch_front_gsl_no_lake.tif        -GSL with lake elevation set to 1250mASL (lake is removed), and assumes 20% erodibility for exposed portions of GSL lake bed

These are average dust PM2.5 concentrations for all dust storms from the spring of 2022. 

KMZ files are also provided for quick visualization for the 20% erodibility scenarios:

20p_dust_projection_1275mASL.kmz            -GSL with lake elevation set to 1275mASL
20p_dust_projection_1277mASL.kmz            -GSL with lake elevation set to 1277mASL
20p_dust_projection_1280mASL.kmz            -GSL with lake elevation set to 1280mASL
20p_dust_projection_1281mASL.kmz            -GSL with lake elevation set to 1281mASL
20p_dust_projection_gsl_no_lake.kmz         -GSL with lake elevation set to 1250mASL (lake is removed)
